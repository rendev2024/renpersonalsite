            <h3>My Biggest Heartbreak</h3>
          <h6>My biggest heartbreak is; when my mother died infront of my eyes while begging and asking God for more time. My mothers death causes me from depression, overthinking, and change me for who i am, its changes how i treat people with kindness and its changes my perspective and whole plan of my life. I think i will ask God why for the rest of my life, and never will come to understand it. Even God himself came infront of me and tell me the reason, i dont think i would accept it. Some loves are too hard to bear, and great loves comes great pain, and with great loss comes the greatest pain of all. If love could saved you, you would have live forever.</h6>

          <h3>My Hobbies/Who am I</h3>
          <h6>I am a former IP address changer at (to risky to mention) and I'd loved doing and exploring new things specially in tech industry and anything that i loved. I loved doing codes, explore new software that helps my learning and develop my unexplored skills. I also loved, basketball, watching tech movies, traveling, and specially being alone for me is priceless. It helps me to manage and organize my subsconious mind, it will help to explore and reprogram my mind everytime nah its feels like I'm hesitated to do something that i wanted. I am a very observant and nerd/introvert man who has the ability to not talking with people specially in most crowded places.</h6>

          <h3>Things I want to Exp.</h3>
          <h6>I wan't to experience things nahh would cry me out of nowhere because of happiness and not on grief and loss. I want to experience surprises, gifts, assurance and time without asking and begging for it because the last time i was surprised its not happines but its about grief and loss when my mother died in front of me and it kills my soul. I want to experience those happiness again when i am with my mother. I want to experience that someone is their for me and will tease if I am really okay everytime na i am not in the mood to talk, nah they would understand and patiently waiting for me.</h6>
